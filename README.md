# Stanford_Machine_Learning_Coursera
This is an online Machine Learning course by Stanford University on coursera.org and I earned a **course certificate** with a **100%** final grade. This repository contains _programming assignments_ I completed using **_Matlab_** such as implementing some common Machine Learning algorithms like Linear regression, KMeans, Logistic regression, or handling several simple problems related to Machine Learning.
